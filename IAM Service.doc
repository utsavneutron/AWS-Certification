IAM: Identity and Access Management Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------
Global Service

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary

- Users: mapped to physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- Groups: contains Users Only
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for uses or groups
- Roles: For EC2 instances or AWS Services
- Security: MFA + Password policy
- Access Keys: Access AWS using CLI or SDK
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports and IAM Access Advisor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM Guidelines and Best Practices

- Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS User
- Assign User to groups and assign permission to groups
- Create a strong Password policy
- Use and enforce Multi factor Authentication
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS Services
- Use Access Keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)
- Audit Permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report and IAM Access Analyzer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IAM: Users and Groups
Root Account created by Default, shouldn't be used or shared

Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
Groups only contain users, not other groups 

IAM: Permissions
Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies


To create User: Go to User and add users
Create Admin account to add user and not use root account

-Create group admin: Then Admin Access
-Add Tags(Optional)
- Download .csv

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IAM Policies:

Structure of JSON File:
- Version: policy language Version
- Id: an identifier for the policy
- Statement: One or more
    o Statement consists of
        Sid: An identifier for the Statement
        Effect: Whether the statement allows or denies Access
        Principal: Account/user/role to which this policy applied to
        Action: List of actions this policy allows or denies
        Resource: List of resources to which the actions applied to
        Condition:

IAM Password policy
Strong Password: Higher security for the account
    Allow IAM users to change their Password
    Prevent Password reuse
    Requires users to change their pw after sometime

Multi Factor Authentication
Users have access to your account and can possible change configuration or delete resources.
MFA: Password + Security Device

Devices:
Virtual MFA Device : Google Authenticator (Phone only) and Authy (multi device) (Support for multiple tokens on a single device)
Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key: Yubikey by Yubico (Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key)
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device 
Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud

Only create access keys from IAM account not root account. It is in Security under users

TO configure AWS:
In CL Prompt: "aws configure"
    - AWS Access Key Id
    - AWS Secret Access Key
    - Default Region
    - Default Output Format: [Press Enter]

Try "aws iam list-users"

Roles

IAM Roles for Services
    - Some AWS Service will need to perform actions on your behalf.
    - will assign permissions to AWS Services with IAM Roles

Common roles:
    - EC2 Instance Roles
    - Lambda Function Roles
    - Roles for Cloud Formation

IAM Security Tools
- IAM Credentials Report (account level)
    o A report that lists all account's users and the status of their various Credentials
- IAM Access Advisor (User Level)
    o Shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
    o Use this information to revise policies.


Credential Report:
- Creates a status report .csv file.

Access Advisor: Users -> Access Advisor
- Remove unused services
