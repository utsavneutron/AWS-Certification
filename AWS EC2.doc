EC2
Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastucture as a Service
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capability:
    - Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
    - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

Knowing EC2 means understanding how cloud works

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EC2 sizing and configuration options

Based on:
    - Operating System
    - CPU
    - RAM
    - Storage space: Network attached (EBS and EFS) or Hardware (EC2 Instance store)
    - Network card: Speed of the card, Public IP address
    - Firewall rules: Security group
    - Bootstrap script (configure at 1st launch): EC2 User data

EC2 User data
    - Possible to Bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
    - Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
    - The script is only run once at the instance first start
    - EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
        - installing updates
        - installing Software
        - Downloading common files from the internet

EC2 User Data is used to bootstrap your EC2 instances using a bash script. This script can contain commands such as installing software/packages, download files from the Internet, or anything you want.

- EC2 User data script runs with the root user

EC2 Instance Types: example
t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (Upto 750 hours per month)

EC2 User data is at the bottom of the Configure Instance bar. There we can paste a script that will be launched during the very and first boot.

EC2 Instance Types

AWS naming convention:

m5.2xlarge
    - m : instance class
    - 5: generation
    - .2xlarge: size within the class


General Purpose: (T and M series)
    - For diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
    - Balance between: Compute, Memory and networking

Compute Optimized: (C series)
    - For compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
        - Batch Processing workloads
        - Media Transcoding
        - High Performance web servers
        - High Performance computing (HPC)
        - Scientific modeling and machine learning
        - Dedicated gaming servers

Memory Optimized: (R series)
    - For workloads that require large data sets in Memory
    -  choose for a critical application that uses an in-memory database?
    - Use cases:
        - High Performance, relational/non-relational databases
        - Distributed web scale cache stores
        - In-memory databases optimized for BI(Business Intelligence)
        - Applications performing real time processing of big unstructured data

Storage Optimized: (i and D series)
    - For storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local Storage
    - Use Cases:
        - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
        - Relational and NoSQL databases
        - Cache for in-memory databases (For example, Redis)
        - Data warehousing Application

Introduction to Security Groups

Security Groups operate at the EC2 instance level and can control traffic.

- Fundamental of network Security in AWS.
- Control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances

- Only contains allow rules
- Security Groups rules can reference by IP or by Security Groups.

- Security Groups can be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same AWS Region/VPC.

To Know:
    - Can be attached to multiple instances
    - Locked downto region/VPC combination
    - Does live "outside" the EC2 - if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won't see it
    - Its good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
    - If application is not accessible (time out), then its a security group issue
    - If application gives a "connection refused" error, then its an application error or its not launched
    - All inbound traffic is blocked by default
    - All outbound traffic is authorized by default.

Important Ports:

22 : SSH (Secure Shell) - Log into a Linux instance
21 : FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
22 : SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - ipload files using SSH
80 : HTTP - access to unsecured sites
443 : HTTPS - access to secured sites
3389 : RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

0.0.0.0/0 = Anywhere in ipV4
::/0 = Anywhere in ipV6

EC2 Instances Purchases options

    - On Demand Instances: Short worload, predictable pricing
        -Pay for what you use:
            - Linux or Windows - Billing per sec, after the first minute
            - All other operating system - Billing per hour
        -Highest Cost but not upfront payment
        -No Long-term commitment
        -Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

    - Reserved: (Minimum 1 year) Betwen 1 to 3 years
        - Reserved Instances: Long workloads
            - Upto 75% discount compared to On-Demand
            - Reservation period: 1 year =+ discount | 3 years = +++discount
            - Purchasing Options: No upfront | partial | all upfront
            - Reserve a specific instance type
            - Recommended for steady state usage applciations (think database)

        - Convertible Reserved Instances: Long workloads with flexible instances
            - Can change the EC2 instance type
            - Upto 54% discount
        - Scheduled Reserved Instances : example - every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm.
            - launch within time window you reserve
            - When you require a fraction of day/week/month
            - Still commitment over 1 to 3 years

    - Spot Instances: Short workloads, cheap, can lose instances(Less Reliable)
        - Can get a discount upto 90% compared to On-demand
        - Instances that you can "lose" at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
        - Most cost efficient instances in AWS
        - Use for workloads that are resilient to failure:
            - Batch Jobs
            - Data Analysis
            - Image Processing
            - Any Distributed workloads
            - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
        -Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

    - Dedicated Hosts: Book an entire physical server, control instance placement.
        - A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully Dedicated for use.
        - Addresses Compliance requirements and reduces costs by allowing us to use our existing server-bound software licenses.
                - Compliance requirements
                - Existing server-bound software licenses
        - Allocated for 3-year period reservation
        - More expensive
    
    - Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL- Bring your own License)
    - Or Companies with strong regulatory or compliance needs

    - EC2 Dedicated Instances
        - Instances running on hardware that's dedicated
        - More like software not hardware
        - May share hardware with other instances in same account
        - No control over instance placement (can move hardware after stop/start)
        - Per instance Billing
